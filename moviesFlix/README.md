## Add at 5 Project features.

-   After all, the home page banner section was affected by the zoom I created. You can see the zoom effect on the homepage banner. I did not create the banner; it comes from 'swiper'.
-   The movie upload section can be found in the top right corner of the login information section. It is accessible under a private route. If this isn't what you were looking for, please provide more context or clarify, and I'll do my best to assist you.
-   It seems like there might be some confusion or a language barrier. If you could provide more context or clarify your question, I would be more than happy to help you.
-   If you want to set a page for watching, click on the movie card anywhere. If you log out, you will be sent to a login page to sign in. When you log in again, you will automatically return to the page you intended to visit.
-   When you log in, you can see an icon on the movie page. This icon is visible when you log in, and you can edit the movie's name, description, or something else.
